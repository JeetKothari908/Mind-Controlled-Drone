TODO (very broadly)

store CSV files of brainwave patterns in channels, along with the target value (like directional intent or panic)
save and load models, most likely using serialized objects (pickles)
each user has their own models due to each person being different in brain function.

decide on the kind of model output we need for this task:
    Classifier: we can look at the inputs and determine which action is most likely (multiclass)
    Regression: based on input, decide how well it matches each intent


likely this data will have to be processed using a CNN on a fourier-transformed representation of the brainwave channels
alternately, an CNN paired with RNN or transformer may be useful to retain context or meaning over time. This would be harder to train

finally, the model output has to be sent to the DJI SDK to fly the thing but that's a whole other can of worms
